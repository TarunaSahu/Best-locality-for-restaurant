<h1>LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING AND SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS TO RECOMMEND A BEST LOCALITY FOR RESTAURANT IN INDORE</h1>
<div>
  <h3>1 The Problem Statement:</h3>
The main reason for failure of a restaurant is starting the restaurant 
without prior analyzing the factors that can affect the restaurant success. 
According to the National Restaurant Association 60% of restaurants shut 
down within the first year of operations, and up to 80% of restaurants 
close their operations in the first five years. The major reason is poor 
location and high rentals i.e. either you are located far from the target 
audience or the location you prefer drains out your pocket
